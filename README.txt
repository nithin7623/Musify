MUSIFY

We done the project in two phases.

In phase 1, we learnt all the NumPy, Pandas and tensorflow package related stuff through videos.
In phase 2, we gone through the article related to Musify(automated music composition) and worked on it.

All_Midi_Files- zip file contains all the training midi files and we used Haydn generated midi files for training the model

Muisfy_SoC.ipynb - code for Musify made using Google Colab

#In this code, while running, we need to upload the All_Midi_Files.zip file during the execution of 2nd cell of code

AI_composed_music.mid - This is a 200 notes audio file generated by using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM), a RNN approach 

Musify - an explaination of the code of Musify in .mp4 format
